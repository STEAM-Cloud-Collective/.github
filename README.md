TITLE: MUSICAL
FORMAT: Screenplay (Parody)

EXT. MISERABLE CHICAGO – DAY

ALEXANDER HAMILTON, a talking cat, dances on stage. 
He is an American Jersey Boy, drenched in grease and lightning.

                    HAMILTON
            (music voice)
        My name is Alexander Hamilton.
        I am the Phantom of the Oprah
        and I never pay rent.

Every word rhymes and the music is instruments. 
ANNIE, the girl with 0 moms and 0 dads, tap dances to hurt the stage.

                    ANNIE
            (with soundliness)
        Tomorrow the sun will appear.
        But it will not give me the parents?
        I shall kill the sun. I get my gun.

Annie dissolves in a puff of music. Hamilton spins around 
for 525,600 minutes.

THE BEAST, a talking cat, drops out of beauty school 
onto the stage. Beast is landlord.

                    BEAST
            (like piano)
        To be guest, you must pay rent!
        Mamma Mia!

Annie, the girl with 0 mammas and 0 mias, enters with her gun. 
She shoots the Beast with a bullet of choreography.

                    ANNIE
            (original cast)
        I dreamed a dream and now I have
        gunned a gun. Give me parents.

The Beast dies and his curse breaks. He was cursed 
to be in a musical. Death ends his curse.
This is the Circle of Life.

                    HAMILTON
            (sung from eyes)
        I am founding father. I will find
        you father. You must buy own mother.
        I am ten dollar man.

Hamilton searches for a father.

MARY PIPPINS, a talking umbrella, flies in on her broom. 
She is blonde, legally.

                    MARY PIPPINS
            (British noises)
        It is intermission.

It is not intermission. Mary's lie will have consequences.
