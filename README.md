- **Officer attendance.** Rotating officers must attend **≥ 85%** of meetings (synchronous or documented asynchronous participation) or risk forfeiting stipend/role.[^f6]
- **Meetings.** Minimum **4 all-hands per year**; agendas circulated in advance; recordings/summaries provided for accessibility and time zones.[^f7]

- **Trauma-informed & restorative.** All reviews use a restorative step prior to sanctions; confidentiality respected to the maximum extent of law.[^f11]

---

## V. Compensation, Profit Sharing, and Stipend Roles
- **No fixed salaries.** Compensation flows via project pay, quarterly profit sharing, and limited rotational stipends for continuity roles.[^f17]
- **Quarterly distributions.** After **10–15%** overhead/reserves, profits are distributed **quarterly** to contributors active within the prior **6 months**, proportional to verified contribution.[^f18]
